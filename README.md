# Peak Scoreboard

I originally created this 2-3 weeks ago. Today, I completed the backend and fixed some UI issues. Consider this a beta release. Feedback is appreciated.

## Features

- Server information display (logo and name)
- Job cards to show the number of players on duty for each job (can be disabled)
- Admin badges next to admins (can be disabled)
- Job badges next to all players (can be disabled)
